## Easy Locate
This project I am trying to demonstrate the usage of restful web services. In this I have also included the restful web services security. 

I have the plan to do the following thing

* some restful web services
* security to the web services
* a SPA(Single Page application) using RequireJS, Backbone.js and JQuery, which will make use of the web services.
* an android and i-os application which can access the same services


## Prerequisites
You need the following packages to be installed:
* Java 7
* Tomcat 7
* Maven 3.0.5
* Git
* MySql
* Apache Httpd

## Building from source
After completing the prerequisites, you can follow the instructions to build the project.

### check out sources

	git clone https://github.com/karasatishkumar/easylocate.git

once you clone the project change the tomcat webapp path in your parent pom.xml. So that your wars will be get copied to webapp.	

### compile and test, build all wars

	mvn clean install

One successfull built the project, you can start tomcat to test..

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Expecting some android and i-os developer to contribute to this.
